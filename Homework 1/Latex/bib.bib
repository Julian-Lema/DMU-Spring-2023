abstract="The need for miniaturization of shock tubes capable of producing overpressures identical to the farfield overpressures produced by the blasts is increasing due to their applications in the study of blast induced traumatic brain injuries (bTBI) using small animals [1] as well as in the design of needleless drug delivery systems [2]. Recently a table-top explosive driven shock tube has been reported for investigating the bTBI and biological tissues in rats [3] by employing exploding rifle primer which creates a shock wave in the rifle barrel. Also a multi-mode shock tube driven by compressed air, compressed helium, oxyhydrogen and RDX explosion for investigating the bTBI has been reported [4].",
